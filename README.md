As a part of my app development internship at Bharat Intern, I was assigned to prepare a Temperature Converter app as task 2. 
I have done this using Java in Android Studio 

# TemperatureConverter
Temperature Converter is a Java-based simple app that converts a given temperature from Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
Simply the user has to give input in one form and this app will convert it into the another form .
